# Sublime Build Systems and Settings
## Sublime Build System

To add the above build systems to your Sublime Text environment, follow these steps:

### Method 1 - Using the code snippet
1. Press the `Ctrl+Shift+p` command to open the Command Palette.
2. Type "New build" and choose the option `"Build: New Build System"`.
3. Copy the code for a particular programming language and paste it into the `<name-of-prog-language>.sublime-build` file.
4. Congratulations! The new Sublime build system is now ready to run and compile the program.

### Method 2 - Using the code file
1. Clone the repository into local directory.
2. Choose a build system file for a particular programming language.
3. Paste the file at the path where other Sublime Text user packages are saved.
4. On a Windows PC, the path will look like this: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text\Packages\User`.
5. Congratulations! The new Sublime build system will now appear alongside other preset Sublime build systems.

### To Use One of the Build Systems
1. Press the key shortcut command `Ctrl+b` to compile the file.
2. Select one of the build systems you recently added to the list.
3. Run the program!

*Alternatively*
1. Click on the "Tools" button in the menu bar.
2. Select the "Build System" option from the "Tools" menu.
3. Choose one of the builds for the particular programming language your code is written in.
4. Run the program using the shortcut command Ctrl+B, which activates the build system for the programming language.

## Sublime dev settings
Every developer needs settings that suit their practical thinking and provide a focused environment. This helps them design functional and efficient code. I am sharing a file of Sublime preferences for day-to-day coding. We can choose any preferences based on which settings are more practical. 

To access the preferences, follow below steps - 
1. Click on the "Preferences" button in the menu bar.
2. Select the "Settings" option from the "Preferences" menu.
3. The above step opens a side-by-side window. Most likely, on your system, the default Sublime settings will be on the left-hand side. To add custom settings, you can edit them in the window on the right-hand side.
4. Copy and paste preferences into your `Preferences.sublime-settings` file to replicate the settings.
5. Congratulations! You have successfully added the custom settings to your Sublime environment.
